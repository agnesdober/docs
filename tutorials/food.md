# Use: track your food!

You probably found Grocy looking for a way to keep inventory of your groceries - and as you guessed from the name, this is its main function. The following tutorial shows you *one* way of doing this. The nice thing about Grocy is that it's flexible, and you can adjust your setup and use according to what is important to you, so use this tutorial as a general guide to understanding how the seperate parts come together before setting up your own use.

## Manage master data

### Goals

We will first set up the basic elements of working with Grocy: locations, quantity units, and product groups. This will help us then set up our products.

### Before you start

You should have a working grocy server or an installed windows app, with users configured.

### The basic building blocks

You can find all of these elements under Manage master data in the side menu. These can always be edited later, including adding, modifying or deleting entries, so there is no need to worry if you leave something out. It's advisable to try and create these first before your products, as it will save you time from having to go back and edit either products or these categories.

**Locations.** You can add elements by clicking the add button on top, giving it a name, optionally a description, and selecting if it is a freezer or not. This latter checkbox is important if you will be using the thawing element later, allowing you to automatically set a short expiration date on items moved from a freezer to a non-freezer location. If you want to later edit a location, simply click on the edit button to take you back to these options. 

**Product groups.** Product groups allow you to later group certain types of products together, such as "Fruits and veggies" or "Spices" etc. Once you've added products, you will be able to filter them according to these.

**Quantity units.** These units will appear with your products (e.g. a bottle of wine, a pack of pasta). Important to note as you configure these is that you are able to set later purchase quantities that differ from stock quantities. An example might be a toilet paper: you might by 1 pack that contains 16 pieces, so feel free to add as many units as you feel fit by clicking on the add button on top.
