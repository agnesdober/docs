# Looking for the docs

Continue to the [Grocy documentation](tutorial.md) or look below for some stuff about the docs and how to help improve them.

# About docs

This repository is for creating documentation for the grocy project. You can find grocy at https://github.com/grocy/grocy 

The four types of documentation that will be needed are:
1. tutorials - learning-oriented, gets first-time users up and running
2. how-tos - problem-oriented, answers specific scenarios
3. explanations - understanding-oriented, gets contributors up and running
4. reference - information-oriented, serves as a repository of knowledge for contributors

This project will first focus on tutorials. This means that:
- the target audience of these writings are first- and second-time users of Grocy.
- the structure should reflect their exploration of functionality
- technical debt should be minimal
- the language should be clear, with short sentences and an informal tone

The main tutorial page is [tutorial.md](tutorial.md)

## Planned how-tos

The main how-to page is the [How-to masterlist](how-to.md)

Notes on how-tos:
- the target audience of these are not only first- and second-time users, but also current users who want to extend functionality
- structure should be specific topic-based, that is, titles should be descriptive
- technical debt should be moderate
- the language should be clear, with short sentences and an informal tone
- topics can first start in the FAQ; if they turn out to be too large, they can be separated into their own pages

- [ ] FAQ
- [ ] How to migrate from HASS to Docker
- [ ] How to set up a barcode scanner
- [ ] Using custom fields
